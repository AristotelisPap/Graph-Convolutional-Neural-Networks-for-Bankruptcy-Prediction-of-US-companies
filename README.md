# Deep Link Prediction for Graphical Database

## 1. Motivation and Goal
In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in the fields of vision, speech, and natural language understanding. The ability of deep learning to extract underlying patterns from complex, large-scale and high-dimensional data is well recognized. Many real-world applications are built on a graphical database, and thus utilize graphs for storing data. The graph here means a directed, attributed multi-graph with data stored as nodes and relationships (links) between nodes stored as edges. Graphical databases are ubiquitous and often consist of hundreds of millions of nodes and relationships. There is rich information embedded in the complex topology of these graphs that can be leveraged when doing inference on the data stored in them. As a result, utilizing deep learning to extract this information has gained a lot of traction in the research community. 

In order to address the aforementioned problem, followed two distinct approaches. In the first approach, we propose a Graph-Based Classification Model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that uses nodal features as well as the structure of a node's local sub-graph to predict links between graph nodes by using an adjacency matrix formulation. In the second approach, we propose a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) which has a structure similar to an autoencoder. This formulation enables us to use our prior information about the structure of the graph more efficiently by putting a relational inductive bias [1] into our model.
