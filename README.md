Project Title: Deep Link Prediction for Graphical Database

Abstract:

In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in the fields of vision, speech, and natural language understanding.
The ability of deep learning to extract underlying patterns from complex, large-scale and high-dimensional data is well recognized. Many real-world applications are built on a graphical database, and thus utilize graphs for storing data. The graph here means a directed, attributed multi-graphs with data stored as nodes and relationships(links) between nodes stored as
edges. Graphical databases are ubiquitous and often consist of hundreds of millions of nodes and relationships. There is rich information embedded in the complex topology of these graphs that can be leveraged when doing inference on the data stored in them. As a result, utilizing deep learning to extract this information has gained a lot of traction in the research community.

Our research contribution in alignment to this is two-fold. First, we propose a Graph-Based Classification Model that uses nodal features as well as the structure of a nodeâ€™s local sub-graph to predict links between graph nodes. Second, we propose that our model can be implemented as a generalized classification model capable of predicting links for a variety of graphical data. The basic idea behind our model is utilizing modern deep learning techniques to learn relational information from local sub-graphs and use it to predict the relationship between the target nodes.
